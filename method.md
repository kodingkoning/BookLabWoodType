# Method

We used a soft maple wood. We purchased a 7.2 bdft board from CU Wood. It was 1.5" deep and about 6.5" wide.

With the assistance of Michael Dalton, we then used the joiner at the Siebel Center for Design (SCD) to minimize the impact of the warping and allow an even edge for the table saw.

Michael crosscut the wood into 0.981" strips using a sled on the table saw, also at SCD. He then cut them to 1.5" tall to enforce the hight of each letter. Before Michael used the sled and the table saw, we also attempted cutting it to typehigh using the miter saw with a stop block and the tablesaw with the sawstop. However, both of these methods were neither accurate nor precise. The only way we found to consistently make blocks of equal depth was to use the sled. This is an advanced technique, which required Michael's expertise. We are not the only ones who have struggled to obtain typehigh wood. Scott Moore created the "Moore Wood Type Machine" to cut his blocks to size. Our blocks are not to the precision of Moore's, but we did not have custom made tools to work with either.

After cutting to size, we applied a coat of Shellac before laser cutter.

We used 108 pt (9 pica) font in Inkscape to create each of the PDFs we sent to the laser cutter. Each of the Inkscape files was 1.5" by 6.25". We downloaded the Digi Grotesk Bold Condensed font from [Wfonts](https://www.wfonts.com/font/digi-grotesk-bold-condensed). We made only the capital letters. For the letter counts, we used [Virgin Wood Type's 3A specs](https://www.virginwoodtype.com/specs/).

We used the TROTEC Speedy 400 flexx laser cutter in the Siebel Center for Design. We did 9 iterations for each letter block. It ran at 50% power and 50% speed and 500 Hertz. Each block took about 17.5 minutes to cut.

We then used a combination of the miter saw and the table saw to cut between the letters, after chiseling any excess wood away. We initially used the miter saw, until we needed to cut between a single pair of letters and the block was too small for the tool.

## Outline:

- Wood we used:
    - soft maple from CU Wood
- Preparing the wood:
    - planed the wood in order to minimize the effect of the warping
- Cutting to type high:
    - tried to use the bandsaw in order to cut to 0.918" high with endgrain (the endgrain should be where the ink goes)
    - We are not the only ones who have struggled to get type high wood: https://moorewoodtype.com/2011/03/type-high-means-type-high-2/
    - Plan: cut to 1" and then plane down to the proper height
- Laser cutter:
    - attached pdfs we sent to the laser cutter
    - Used 100% power and 75% speed, as that was what was required for maple
    - also used layers of Shellac before and after using the laser cutter
    - used multiple runs until the cuts were deep enough
- Specs for count of letters: https://www.virginwoodtype.com/specs/
    - only made capital letters. Used 3A specs
    - downloaded font at: https://www.wfonts.com/font/digi-grotesk-bold-condensed
- include the printing process
- include images from cutting the wood
