# Method

The goal of this section is to explain what work we did to create the letters. It should be specific enough that other students could also create wood blocks.

## Outline:

- Wood we used:
    - soft maple from CU Wood
- Preparing the wood:
    - planed the wood in order to minimize the effect of the warping
- Cutting to type high:
    - tried to use the bandsaw in order to cut to 0.918" high with endgrain (the endgrain should be where the ink goes)
    - We are not the only ones who have struggled to get type high wood: https://moorewoodtype.com/2011/03/type-high-means-type-high-2/
    - Plan: cut to 1" and then plane down to the proper height
- Laser cutter:
    - attached pdfs we sent to the laser cutter
    - Used 100% power and 75% speed, as that was what was required for maple
    - also used layers of Shellac before and after using the laser cutter
    - used multiple runs until the cuts were deep enough
- Specs for count of letters: https://www.virginwoodtype.com/specs/
    - only made capital letters. Used 3A specs
- include the printing process
- include images from cutting the wood
