# Method


We used a soft maple wood. We purchased a 7.2 bdft board from [CU Woodshop](https://www.cuwoodshop.com/). It was 1.5" deep and about 6.5" wide.

With the assistance of Michael Dalton, a designer at the University of Illinois' [Siebel Center for Design (SCD)](https://designcenter.illinois.edu/), we used a joiner to minimize the impact of the warping and allow an even edge for the table saw.

Michael crosscut the wood into 0.981" strips using a [sled on the table saw](media/sled.jpg). He then cut them to 1.5" tall to enforce the height of each letter. Before Michael used the sled and the table saw, we failed in two attempts to cut the wood to type-high. In our first attempt, we tried cutting the wood using the miter saw with a stop block. We next tried the tablesaw with the sawstop. We found that neither of these methods to be accurate nor precise. The only way we found to consistently make blocks of equal depth was to use the sled. We enlisted Michael's expertise to use this slid because it required a level of skill beyond our abilities. 

In our research, we discovered that we are not the only ones who have struggled to obtain type-high wood. Scott Moore of Moore Wood Type, created a ["Moore Wood Type Machine"](https://moorewoodtype.com/2011/03/type-high-means-type-high-2/) to cut his blocks to size. Our blocks are not to the precision of Moore's, but we did not have custom made tools to work with either (yet).

After cutting to size, we applied a coat of Shellac before [laser cutting](media/lasered.jpg).

We used 108 pt (9 pica) font in Inkscape to create each of the PDFs we sent to the laser cutter. Each of the Inkscape files was 1.5" by 6.25". We downloaded the Digi Grotesk Bold Condensed font from [Wfonts](https://www.wfonts.com/font/digi-grotesk-bold-condensed). For this experiment, we opted to make only the capital letters and numbers. We used [Virgin Wood Type's 3A specs](https://www.virginwoodtype.com/specs/) to determine the character counts. These specs gave us 75 letters and 26 numbers. To this, we added [7 additional punctuation characters](media/PUNC.pdf).

We used the TROTEC Speedy 400 flexx laser cutter in the Siebel Center for Design. We did 9 iterations for each letter block. It ran at 50% power and 50% speed and 500 Hertz with the CO2 cut method. By refocusing the laser and resetting it to (0,0) on each pass, we were able etch on a consistent line height and thus, make each block uniformly tall. Each block of wood took about 17.5 minutes to cut on the laser. After cutting these blocks of wood, we were left with [108 wood-type blocks](media/blocks.jpg).

We then used a combination of the miter saw and the table saw to cut between the letters, after chiseling any excess wood away. We initially used the miter saw, until we needed to cut between a single pair of letters and the block was too small for the tool. We did not standardize the kerning between our letters. Our next iteration of this process will be more precise. 

## Outline:

- Wood we used:
    - soft maple from CU Wood
- Preparing the wood:
    - planed the wood in order to minimize the effect of the warping
- Cutting to type high:
    - tried to use the bandsaw in order to cut to 0.918" high with endgrain (the endgrain should be where the ink goes)
    - We are not the only ones who have struggled to get type high wood: https://moorewoodtype.com/2011/03/type-high-means-type-high-2/
    - Plan: cut to 1" and then plane down to the proper height
- Laser cutter:
    - attached pdfs we sent to the laser cutter
    - Used 100% power and 75% speed, as that was what was required for maple
    - also used layers of Shellac before and after using the laser cutter
    - used multiple runs until the cuts were deep enough
- Specs for count of letters: https://www.virginwoodtype.com/specs/
    - only made capital letters. Used 3A specs
    - downloaded font at: https://www.wfonts.com/font/digi-grotesk-bold-condensed
- include the printing process
- include images from cutting the wood
