# Introduction


Out goal for this project is to make a set of woodblock type for a letterpress. Our experiment hopes to produce a streamlined, reproducible method of making woodblock type. We hope to use this project as a jumping off point for others to follow our techniques within the framework of minimal computing principles. 

Our experiment combines digital and historic techniques of typographic production that allow for the reproduction of a digital font for a moveable type printing press. Particularly, we chose a typeface that was developed on a CRT screen using digital typesetting methods but without personal and minicomputers. We revive this digital font for a physical format to reconsider the processes lost in material type creation.

We also recognize that purchasing woodblock type, whether new or historical, can be prohibitively difficult and expensive for local presses or schools. Our project takes these financial costs into consideration. We walk through our methods, results, and mistakes as we experiment with physical font production. Through this process, we aim to present a viable means for others to produce their own moveable type following similar methods by using accessible materials and equipment. We present these as important factors in thinking about sustainable textual production, as well as furthering new directions in book history and digital humanities.

## Background

We chose as [Digi Grotesk](https://www.linotype.com/332/digi-grotesk-family.html) as our font. This is an early digital typeface that was derived from the late 19th-century [Akzidenz-Grotesk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akzidenz-Grotesk). Digi Grotesk was one of the fonts developed on Rudolf Hell's [Digiset Machine](https://www.hell-kiel.de/en/hell-development/typesetting-technology/digiset) in the [late 1960s](media/digigrotesk.png) (See page Page 8 of [Digiset 50T1 Prospekt Manual](media/Digiset_50_T1_Prospekt_1969_03.pdf)). Existing in the space between traditional and computational, Hell's Digiset was one of the first machines to allow for digital typesetting. While it is beyond the scope of this project, the Digiset is tied to a digital phototypesetting typesetting revolution and was rebranded as RCA's Videocomp in the United States.  The rights for this font are currently held by the Linotype Company.
