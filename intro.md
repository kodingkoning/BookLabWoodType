# Introduction

Out goal for this project is to make a set of woodblock type for a letterpress. Our experiment hopes to produce a streamlined, reproducible method of making woodblock type and hope to use this project as a jumping off point for others to follow our techniques within the framework of minimal computing principles. 

The our experiment combines digital and historic techniques of typographic production that allow for the reproduction of a digital font for a moveable type printing press. We recognize that purchasing woodblock type, whether new or historical, can be prohibitively difficult and expensive for local presses or schools. We will walk through our methods, results, and mistakes. Through this project, we aim to present a viable means for others to produce their own moveable type with similar digital methods using accessible materials and equipment. Furthermore, we hope to showcase the ways in which a digital font has been reimagined and reused in a traditional print medium. Through this revitalization of a font, we hope to draw attention to an overlooked aspect of book and computing history. Finally, we consider our environmental impact and include these considerations in our choice to use our method over other 3D printing techniques. We present these as important factors in thinking about sustainable textual production, as well as furthering new directions in book history and digital humanities.


## Outline:

- Our goal in this project is to make a set of woodblock type for the printing presses
- Woodblock type is very expensive, whether it is used on Ebay or purchased new from the few places whrere they still make it.
- Our woodblocks will mostly be used for poster making
- Readings that reference woodblocks:
    - Werner text: 65-66 gives a description of what a woodblock is. 88-89 describes initial letters as woodblocks
