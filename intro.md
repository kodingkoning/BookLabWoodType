# Introduction

## Outline:

- Our goal in this project is to make a set of woodblock type for the printing presses
- Woodblock type is very expensive, whether it is used on Ebay or purchased new from the few places whrere they still make it.
- Our woodblocks will mostly be used for poster making
- Readings that reference woodblocks:
    - Werner text: 65-66 gives a description of what a woodblock is. 88-89 describes initial letters as woodblocks
