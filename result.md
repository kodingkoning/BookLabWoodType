We produced [108 woodblock letters](media/blocks.jpg). While these letters were uniform in height, they varied in width. Due to technical limitations, we did not take kerning into consideration as we cut our blocks of wood into letters. That being said, there is only slight variations in width between letters. As we've moved into printing, we are unable to notice significant variation in width.

We [locked our type](media/locked.jpg) and [printed "HELLO WORLD!"](media/printing.jpg) with both a vertical and horizonal border. After running a few test prints and trying out various types of paper, we were [satisfied with the results on an eggshell white paper](media/prints.jpg). We were surpised that this part of the process went so smoothly. Because our wood blocks were so uniform in height, little work was required to produce a satifactory print. Additionally, it became clear as we printed that the wood was planed correctly and distributed ink evenly across each block. 


This will be descriptions and images of the finished woodblocks and what we print with them.
